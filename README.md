# House-price-prediction
Used a data set from kaggle

For the first run, I used Logistic Regression as a base model to make the model work.
Currently the model uses basic data preprocessing and algorith

The next step would be to imporove the feature enginnering and data preprocessing in general and after that better alogorithm and then boosting it 

these are the current results of the model
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 152447.2037765533
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 48710428800.922325
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 220704.39234623837
R-squared (RÂ²): 0.5748966162728959
accuracy = 57.48966162728959%
